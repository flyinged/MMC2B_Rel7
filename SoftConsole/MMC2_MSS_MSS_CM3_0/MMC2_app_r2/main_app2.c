/* Write handler for mss_i2c0 slave mode
 *
 * The instance parameter is a pointer to the mss_i2c_instance_t for which this
 * slave write handler has been declared.
 * The data parameter is a pointer to a buffer (received data buffer) holding
 * the data written to the MSS I2C slave.
 * The size parameter is the number of bytes held in the received data buffer.
 *
 * Handler functions must return one of the following values:
 *     MSS_I2C_REENABLE_SLAVE_RX
 *     MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX.
 * If the handler function returns MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX, the MSS I2C slave
 *  responds to subsequent write requests with a non-acknowledge bit (NACK),
 *  until the received data buffer content has been processed by some other part
 *  of the software application.
 *  A call to MSS_I2C_enable_slave() is required at some point after
 *  returning MSS_I2C_PAUSE_SLAVE_RX in order to release the received data
 *  buffer so it can be used to store data received by subsequent I2C write
 *  transactions.
 *
 * Defining the macro MSS_I2C_INCLUDE_SLA_IN_RX_PAYLOAD causes the driver to
 * insert the actual address used to access the slave as the first byte in the
 * buffer. This allows applications tailor their response based on the actual
 * address used to access the slave (primary address or GCA).
